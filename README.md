This project implements a basic image encryption and decryption technique using chaotic Logistic Mapping. It leverages a chaotic sequence generated by the Logistic Map to perform XOR operations with pixel values of an image. The encryption process modifies the image by XORing each pixel with a corresponding key value derived from the chaotic sequence, resulting in an encrypted image. Decryption is achieved by applying the same XOR operation with the same key, which restores the original image. This method provides a simple introduction to image encryption and the use of chaotic systems in cryptography, demonstrating both the encryption and decryption processes visually.
