<h1>Image Encryption Using Chaotic Logistic Mapping</h1>

This project demonstrates an image encryption and decryption technique using chaotic Logistic Mapping. By leveraging a chaotic sequence generated by the Logistic Map, this method XORs with pixel values to achieve encryption and decryption.<br>

Key Features
Chaotic Encryption: Utilizes a chaotic key sequence from the Logistic Map for pixel-wise XOR encryption.<br>
Image Handling: Encrypts and decrypts images, allowing visualization of the original, encrypted, and decrypted results.<br>
Simple Implementation: A straightforward approach to understanding basic image encryption and decryption.<br>

Requirements - <br>

Python packages:<br>
numpy<br>
opencv-python<br>
keygenerator (custom module for key generation)<br>

File Structure
encrypt_decrypt_image.py: Main script for encryption and decryption.
keygenerator.py: Module containing the key generation function.
images/: (Optional) Directory for input and output images.
How It Works
Key Generation: Uses chaotic Logistic Map to generate a sequence for XOR operations.
Encryption: Applies XOR between pixel values and key values to produce an encrypted image.
Decryption: Re-applies XOR with the same key to retrieve the original image.
